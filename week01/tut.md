**TUTES DO NOT REPLACE LECTURES**
 * Take a quick look at tute questions before class
 * You don't need to do lab questions beforehand
 * Participation in tutes/labs strong criteria for tutoring role

Technically 1 hr tute, 2 hr lab but can be flexible to suit.

Assessments
* Lab exercises: 15% (mostly done in class)
* Weekly mini-tests: 10% (due end of each week from week 3)
* Assignment 1: 15% (tentatively due beginning week 7, might change)
* Assignment 2: 15% (tentatively due end week 10, might change)
* Final exam: 45%

## Icebreakers

We'll get to it :)

## COMP1511 revision

(Whoops sorry sent the wrong link)

## Tute questions

There's no way we're getting through all the official tute questions, so probably run through these useful questions:

* Q6 (structs)
* Q8 (pointers)
* Q9 (pointers)
* Q10 (recursion)

Q12/13/14 would be useful but not sure if we have time.  
Break up class into groups, ask them to discuss amongst themselves and then share answers with class.

* Don't re-teach 1511 stuff unless they specifically ask.
* Except the following (not covered in all 1511 terms):
   * Recursion
   * Global and `static` variables
   * Struct pointer vs value (covered in 1511 but too many students just don't get it)
* If they have other issues they can ask for personal help during labs.

## Lecture content (number representation/bitwise operations)

* How many people actually watched the lecture?
* Who understands what it talked about?

Break them up into groups again, give them a quiz of different bitwise operations and a link to a guide.

## Lab time

* Feel free to help explain things to others, but each person needs to individually submit
* Put up hand for tutor help or 1-on-1 tutor chat
